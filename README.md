# IoUCO2
IOUCO2 is a decentralized way of paying back the carbon emissons you create by flying (i.e. to Hackathons all over the world) by calculating the carbon emission of your flight and donating an specific amount to an environment-friendly charity.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
Put the SmartCode into Remix. 


## Built With

* [ChainLink](https://chain.link/) - Communicating between the SmartContract and the BrighterFuture-API and back
* [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) - Storing static websites on the blockchain
* [Portis](https://www.portis.io//) - Gives you a user-friendly approach to logging into your Wallet with a Username + Passwort instead of MetaMask's private key approach. 
* [Skale](https://skalelabs.com/) - For extra-fast transactions on the blockchain and because it's cheaper (moneywise and environmental-wise) than Ethereum PoW. 
* [Impact BrighterFuture API](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/flights.json?destination_airport=CDG&origin_airport=SXF&timeframe=2019-01-01%2F2020-01-01) - Used to calculate the CO2-Emission of your flight
